<h1>About Julia Juarez-Kostelnik</h1>
<p>I was born in Seattle, Washington on October 7th, 2000. In 5th grade I moved to Shoreline, Wa and have been there ever since.
  In the fall I will be a senior at Shorewood High School. I love watching tv, marathoning Harry Potter, and adopting animals.
  I currently have two cats, Charlie and Hazel, and one dog, Peggy. I'm pretty sure this is the lowest my pet count has been in years.
  I must fix that! My favorite tv shows alter almost monthly but my all time favorites are Blue Bloods, Law and Order: SVU, Greys Anatomy
  and Gilmore Girls. In my freetime I love volunteering at Seattle Humane and roadtripping around the PNW. As for my dislikes,
  I don't fancy Donald Trump or bell peppers and I have an irrational fear of... deers (but only at night!)</p>
